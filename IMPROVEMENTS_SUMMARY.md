   - Received messages: Pure white `#ffffff` with subtle border
   - Added gentle drop shadows in light mode (barely visible)
   - Changed radius from 16px → 8px (more accurate)
   - Dark text on sent messages for better readability

3. **Borders & Shadows**
   - Reduced border opacity: 8% → 6% (more subtle)

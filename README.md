### Help us

If you're wondering how could you help, fear not, there are plenty of ways
:smile:

Some of them are:

- Spread the good word about qTox to make it more popular :smile:
- Have an opinion? Make sure to [voice it in the issues that need it] :wink:
- Fixing [easy issues] or [issues that need help]. Make sure to read
  [Contributing] first though :wink:
- [Testing] and [reporting bugs]
- [Translating, it's easy]
- [Reviewing and testing pull requests] ‚Äì you don't need to be able to code to
  do that :wink:
- Take a task from our Roadmap below

### Roadmap

Currently qTox is under a feature freeze to clean up our codebase and tools.
During this time we want to prepare qTox for upcoming new features of toxcore.

The next steps are:

- move all toxcore abstractions into their own subproject
- write basic tests for this Core
- format the code base
- rethink our Issue tracker

The current state is tracked in the [Code cleanup] project.

### Screenshots
